# Rate My Classmate

Idea based off of ratemyprofessors.com, except instead of teachers you can rate your class members or group members. Check their rating before you allow them in to your group, because no one wants to be stuck with a team of under achievers!

Created using JavaServer Pages, a somewhat outdated technology that allows for dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Project also uses MySQL as a database, and Apache Ant to automatically run build scripts.
